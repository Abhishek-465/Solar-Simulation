# Solar System Simulator

This project simulates the orbits of terrestrial planets around the Sun using Python and Pygame. It demonstrates the distances of the planets from the Sun and their orbital paths. Additionally, it includes a scenario where the Sun is replaced by a black hole of the same mass, proving that the orbits of the planets remain unchanged.

## Features

- Realistic simulation of the orbits of terrestrial planets.
- Visualization of the distances of planets from the Sun.
 ## Two scenarios:
- Normal simulation with the Sun.
- Simulation with the Sun replaced by a black hole of solar mass.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek-465/Solar-Simulation.git
   cd Solar-Simulation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python solar_system.py
   ```
## Conclusion
The replacement of the Sun with a black hole of the same mass does not change the gravitational environment of the solar system. The planets continue to orbit as they did before because the gravitational force acting on them remains unchanged.

This concept is an illustration of how gravity works and highlights the fact that the source of gravitational force (whether itâ€™s a star or a black hole) affects objects in the same way as long as the mass and distance remain constant.
